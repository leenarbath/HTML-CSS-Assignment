            <p>Dear potential Suitor, Friend, or Random Curious Bystander,</p>
            <p>Are you tired of running into the same old type of people with basic interests and personalities? Do you yearn 
                for someone who doesn't shy away from adventure, mud splatters, the occasional bug in the teeth (or in the 
                helmet), and being dumped unceremoniously into a heap on a mountain or into a rock? Well, you're in luck 
                because I'm here to tell you why you should be racing down the trail of love with me, the mountain biking 
                extraordinaire!</p>
            <h1>I Can Fix a Flat Tire and Your Broken Heart</h1>
                <p>Let's face it; life is full of unexpected bumps, both on and off the trail. But, fear not, because I come 
                    equipped with not just a spare tube, but also a heart that's resilient and ready for the unexpected. 
                    My friendship comes with the added bonus of loyalty and comraderie to get you through whatever rough times 
                    life brings you. I will be there, ready to jam out in the car, and with all the rom coms and carbs you could
                    ever want. Whether it's a punctured tire or a rough day at work, I've got the tools and tenacity to handle it
                    all. Plus, my dad is a certified mechanic, so you will have the extra perks of someone who would probably be
                    willing to work on your bike. *just note: we are not currently accepting applications from people who own 
                    <em>Specialized</em> brand bikes. They are an abomination to the biking community and would not even be 
                     considered. Buy a different bike and try coming back. </p>
            <h1>I Navigate Relationships Like Technical Descents</h1>
                <p>Relationships can be tricky, just like navigating a technical descent. But worry not, because I have
                    the technical ability and skill to navigate a double-black diamond trail in record time and take the twists,
                    turns, and occasional rocky patches that come with any relationship, all while keeping a smile on my face.
                    As an award-winning member of Utah State University's (USU) cycling team, I have won first place in multiple
                    downhill events on some rough trails. Plus, my favorite trail in the world is Grafton Mesa in St. George, 
                    so you know I'm up for a challenge and not afraid of bumps and rocky times.</p>
            <h1>I'm well-Versed in the Art of Falling (and Getting Back Up)</h1>
                <p>When I say I mountain bike, it may be more accurate to say that I mountain-crash. I have had my fair share 
                    of gnarly crashes and not-too-pleasant injuries. Throughout it all, mountain biking has taught me that 
                    falling is inevitable, but the key is to get back up, dust yourself off, and keep riding. This resilience 
                    extends beyond the trail - I understand that setbacks happen, and I'm always ready to face them head-on 
                    with a positive attitude. This has a lot of practical applicability in the real world and directly relating
                    to your friendship package. I don't let any injury or difficulty stop me from continuing on and finishing 
                    the trail or the race, no matter how hard it may be. I love unexpected moments and failures because I think 
                    they add so much to life! </p>
